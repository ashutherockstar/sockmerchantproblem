So one way to solve for the sock merchant challenge is to sort the array, compare each item side by side to find a pair and total the number of pairs we find

So our first step, we will create a variable to hold the sorted array and use the built-in sort method the sort method can take a compare function as an argument. 
The passed-in compare function will ensure that items are sorted in ascending order

Next, we create a pairs variable which will hold the final count, we default it to 0

At this point, this would be the expected output from sorted if we were to pass in our socks array

Next, we set up a for loop.
We naturally start at index 0 but since we are going to compare items side by side we make a full stop at last index

Now we can compare each item of the array with its direct sibling to
Find a pair

We increment the pair's value if we find a match. We also increment i
By one to skip the next item since we have already checked it

If the two items do not match the normal loop cycle will continue

We have now sorted and compared side by side letâ€™s run our solution
